# Model-Training-With-Game
A research project aimed at creating an AI agent that learns to play a specific game through reinforcement learning (RL).
## Features
* Implementation of the game environment (e.g., in Unity or Unreal Engine).
* Training the agent using RL algorithms (e.g., Q-learning, Deep Q-Networks).
* Evaluation of the agent's performance compared to other methods.
## Technologies 
* Python,
* TensorFlow/PyTorch,
* Unity/Unreal Engine,
* Reinforcement Learning.
**Status: In progress.**
